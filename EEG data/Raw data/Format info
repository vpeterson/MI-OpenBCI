We finally kept in our databse EEG data coming from 10 subjects. We provide here the OpenViBe files (ov) of each experimental Run
(RUN0-RUN4).
The files contain the filtered EEG signal during acquisition. For better signal-to-noise ratio a post-filtering step might be necessesary 
(set opt.filt=1 in the file "GenerateData.m" provided in the Matlab file folder).
For converting the ov files to matlab files we use the ov2mat converter toolbox available at http://openvibe.inria.fr/converting-ov-files-to-matlab/
