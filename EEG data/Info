We provide here the raw EEG signals acquired by using the Electro-Cap System II (Electrocap, USA) connected to the
OpenBCI Cyton + Daisy board (Open-BCI, USA). Fifteen (15) electrodes covering the sensorimotor cortex 
(Fz, F3, F4, F7, F8, Cz, C3, C4, T3, T4, Pz, P3, P4, T5, T6) were used. 
The reference and ground electrodes were placed at the left and right ear lobes, respectively.
The sampling frequency of the OpenBCI amplifier was 125 Hz.
