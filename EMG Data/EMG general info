Raw EMG data acquired with Ganglion board (OpenBCI, USA) connected to two Myoware sensors (Advancer Technologies, USA). 
Data from 11 subjects is provided. Note that subjects S01 and S11 had to be dismissed due to problems during signal acquisition. 
S13 was not considered in the further EEG experiment given the high number of EEG trials
contaminated by EMG activity (run "DetectEMGActivation.m" script to prove this)

EMG processing functions are provided in the Matlab files folder. 
See ConvertEMGFiles.m function to convert the txt to Matlab files.
